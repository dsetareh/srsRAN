The demo experiments use lxc containers for each UE, eNB, EPC and MBMS application instance.

The UE and eNB communicate via a shared memory address space using the shmemrf device.

The eNB commiuncates with the EPC and MBMS via ethnet bridge interface.

These demos use a package called letce2 which is a lightweight experiment template configuration environment 
that provides hierarchical mechanisms for generating configuration from templates.

See : https://github.com/adjacentlink/letce2
For more on building and installing this package.

The majority of the configuration is handled in the boostrap config file in each the exp-xx directories.

The supplied demo.env will allow each demo experiment to run without installing and of the applications in this project,
it basically sets you PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variables.

The default cmake build target directory is "build_fauxrf" change this in the demo.env if needed or create a symlink etc.
